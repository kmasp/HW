N-Queens

a) 2x2
Not possible. At this size, a single queen can cover every square.

b)3x3
Also not possible. Placing each queen on a different row and column would still allow a diagonal capture.

c)4x4
Two solutions. Does not work if a queen is placed in a corner.
First implementation of a key strategy: the knight-shape.
By placing a queen any one square from the edge, then placing queens in an L-shape.

d)5x5
Definately possible.
Can be solved by placing a queen in the corner, then connecting the remaining queens via L-shape.

e)6x6
Also possible. 
One solution involves (on a board of a-f and 1-6):
a2,b4,c6,d1,e3,f5

f)7x7
Possible as well.
A little tricky, after a couple of tries:
a2,b5,c3,d1,e7,f4,g6

g)8x8
I know is possible.
The most least intuitive of the 8.
a4,b6,c3,d5,e2,f8,g1,h7
