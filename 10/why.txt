MergeSort is an O(n(log(n)) notation.

In order for the algorithm to merge and complete, it must have a set of already sorted lists.
These arrays are obtained by splitting the original dataset into lists in half, until the lists are of length 1.
Since they are length 1, they are sorted since they are the only number in the list.
Then we start merging adjacent lists, doubling the size.
The runtime for just merging the lists (combining two lists to double its size and sort them in the same process) should be log(n).
Since we are comparing each element of the list individually, there will be n amount of merges.
This means the complete runtime for the algorithm will be the merges * the number of elements.
This results in O(nlog(n)).
